# Relocaliser 3000â„¢

An extremely difficult-to-speedrun entry to [GAMES MADE
QUICK???](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick).

## Playing on Twitter

When a game starts, [@relocaliser](https://twitter.com/relocaliser) posts a
recursively translated game name. You play by replying to the most recent one
of these with what you think the actual game name is. If you are correct, your
answer will be retweeted and a new game will start.

Answers are case-insensitive, but punctuation should be correct. Game names are
taken at random from [Giant Bomb's wiki](https://www.giantbomb.com/games/), so
if you're struggling with what variation of the name of a game to use, consult
their database.

Games end when someone gets the answer right, or when a guess is submitted more
than an hour after the clue was posted.

## Playing locally (or making your own frontend)

You'll need to get yourself a [Giant Bomb](http://www.giantbomb.com/api/) API
key and put it into a `keys.py` file alongside the other files in your local
version. You should format it like this:

```python
giantbomb = 'your giant bomb api key'
```

A prototype for this file can be found in `keys.py.prototype`. (If you only
want to play locally, you can ignore the Twitter-related lines.)

You'll then need to `cd` to your cloned repository and run `pip3 install -r
requirements.txt`. Once you've done that, you should install Argos Translate's
language models as per [their documentation][argos].

With all that done, you should be able to play the game on the command line by
running `python3 game.py`.

If you want to write another frontend, you should be able to import everything
you need from `game.py`, and look at `twitter.py` as an example.

## Running the twitter bot

I recommend you make sure you can play locally before you do this, but once you
have, make yourself a [Twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com) and add something
resembling the following to your `keys.py`:

```python
consumer_key = 'consumer key'
consumer_secret = 'consumer secret'
access_token = 'access token'
access_token_secret = 'access token secret'
```

Then, run `python3 twitter.py` to run a single game. On my server, I have
`while :; do python twitter.py; sleep 10; done` running in a `tmux` session, to
automatically have a new game begin after one ends.
